## 🧭 Overview and Capabilities

**PlanEasy WebGIS Framework** is a **cloud-based platform** designed for **land-use and transport planning**, 
enabling researchers and institutions to **visualize, integrate, and analyze spatial and mobility data** directly in the browser.  

It integrates mapping, analytics, and user-interaction components to support **evidence-based decision-making** in domains such as:

- transport planning and accessibility analysis  
- safety and accident mapping  
- mobility behaviour and survey integration  
- environmental and socio-demographic studies  

PlanEasy operates as a **flexible, browser-based WebGIS environment**, combining **interactive maps**, **real-time databases**, and **analytical dashboards** to deliver an end-to-end system for spatial and participatory research.

> These guidelines describe the **core architecture**, **data standards**, and **ethical principles** underpinning PlanEasy.  
> They are intended for developers, researchers, and institutions seeking to deploy or replicate PlanEasy-based applications.

### 🧰 What You Can Do with PlanEasy

With the **PlanEasy** platform you can:

- 🗺️ Load and explore spatial data (Shapefile, GeoJSON, OSM, CSV, GTFS)  
- 🚍 Import transport networks and run analyses (shortest path, routing, accessibility)  
- 📊 Manage and filter large datasets through responsive tables  
- 📈 Visualize spatial KPIs and transport indicators interactively  
- 🧠 Integrate web-based surveys for behavioural and perception data  
- 🖱️ Interact dynamically with maps, layers, and dashboards directly in your browser  

PlanEasy is optimized for both **research** and **institutional** use, providing a ready-to-use environment for **mobility**, **safety**, and **land-use analysis**.

## ⚙️ Main Components of the PlanEasy Platform

| Module | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frontend WebGIS** | Browser-based interface for map visualization, dashboards, and user interaction |
| **Database Layer** | Cloud-hosted databases (e.g. Firestore, MongoDB) enabling real-time data access and collaboration |
| **Computation Engine** | Algorithms for routing, accessibility, and spatial analysis |
| **API Layer** | REST/JSON interfaces for integration with external systems and automation pipelines |
| **Dashboard / KPIs** | Visualization tools for mobility indicators, safety metrics, and planning outcomes |

Each module can operate independently or in conjunction with participatory components such as the [**PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework**](https://github.com/planeasy-webgis/planeasy-crowdsourcing-framework),  
enabling full interoperability across research projects.

## 🧪 Example Applications

PlanEasy has been successfully applied in multiple research and planning contexts:

| Application | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Public Transport Demand Estimation for Large Events** | Integration of tourist accommodations, attractions, and GTFS data to estimate additional public transport demand during the Jubilee event in Rome. |
| **[Road Safety Analysis](https://road-safety.wemolab.eu/)** | Interactive visualization and filtering of accident datasets, supporting safety planning and risk assessment. |
| **[Accessibility Studies](https://reachability.wemolab.eu/)** | Evaluation of travel times and accessibility to schools, workplaces, and services via public transport. |
| **[Multilingual Surveys](https://questionnaire-builder.wemolab.eu/)** | Integration of web-based surveys for collecting mobility and perception data (e.g., perceived safety, mode choice). |

> Demo dashboards and datasets will be linked here as soon as they are released.
